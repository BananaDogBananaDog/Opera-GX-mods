All of the sounds i used are obtained from me recording the audios inside of Hypixel Skyblock and i do not own any of them.
the wallpaper i used is a screen recording of the Minecraft home page with the texture pack ‘Furfsky reborn v1.7.3’ on and by removing all the GUI in front of it.
For the icon of the mod i used the profile pic of Hypixel skyblock’s official twitter account.
All the music i used as background is from ShinkoNet channel on Youtube and i totally give all the credit to the channel since i didn’t bother to record everything by myself.
